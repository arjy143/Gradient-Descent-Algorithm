# Gradient-Descent-Algorithm
Gradient descent algorithm in python with an example.

Explanation:

I have 5 input co-ordinates here:

These are shown on a scattergraph like this:

I will use the gradient descent algorithm to find an approximation of a line of best fit for these points.

The following picture shows the 3d graph of the loss function:

Finally the line of best fit is displayed in red, and the previous iterations are displayed as blue lines.
